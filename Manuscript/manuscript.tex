Within a standard compartmental model for the description of the dynamic of an epidemics (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead), we considered a policy-maker (PM) that impose stochastically three types of lock-down with increasing force. The probability by which the PM apply the lock-down reflects the different attitudes of a PM to face an epidemics (e.g. \textit{laissez-faire} vs very strict): thus depending on this probabilistic-parameter different scenario were simulated. For each of them we predicted a selected set of economic impacts by using parameters estimated via econometric techniques (Difference-in -Difference) on the microeconomic data of Italy. The comparison of the different impacts provide a bird's-eye view on the socio-economic consequences of the PM attitude

\section{Introduction}

The recent pandemic due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus, opened a highly debated issue about what it would be the best approach of the policy maker to face the epidemics. Differently from the pandemics of the past and in particular of the XX century (e.g. Spanish Flu, Asiatic Flu and Hong Kong Flu), for this pandemic a very large amount of data are easily accessible. As consequence not only the modelling of the virus diffusion, but also the effect on socio-economic texture for the different countries can be investigated with a finer resolution. Among the different scientific challenges that can come up in this context, a interesting one involves the socio-economic effects of the attitude of the policy-maker (PM) to block the circulation of people (lock-down) in order to reduce the contagion rate (more formally the reproduction number, as described in Supporting Infomation). Indeed the policy maker can adopt, at a first approximation, a linear combination between these two extreme approaches: forcing all people to stay at home or to \textit{laissez-faire}. In the first extreme, the spread of virus is, of course, stopped but, on the other side, the toll for such approach is that not only the economic activity (and so the income of people/firms) but also that the furniture of the primary goods are stopped. On the other side, if no lock-down measures are taken by the policy-maker, the toll to be paid will be not only the high number of deaths but also the economic damage produced by the very high number of deaths \cite{Correia2020,karlsson2014impact}. In practice the PM can adopt intermediate approaches that shut down activities that contribute much more to diffusion with respect to other (for this purpose a very fine analysis was provided by Li et al. in  \cite{li2021temporal} and by Brauner et al. in \cite{brauner2021inferring}): as consequence the lock-down efficacy, within certain limits, can be tuned. In the literature different scholars \cite{kabir2020evolutionary,rowthorn2020cost} challenged the issue of finding the optimal lock-down policy for minimizing the economic impact as well as the deaths. In particular for the model in Ref. \cite{kabir2020evolutionary} it is assumed that the policy-maker know perfectly the consequences of her choices and that she can act without delay to impose the optimal choice; finally it is assumed that the PM can impose a continuous factor for the lock-down, while, for different countries such factor seems to be much more discrete. It can be argued that most of these drawbacks of this last formidable research, are entangled with the fact that a deterministic approach was considered for the activation of the lock-downs by the policy maker. On this basis we would propose here an alternative way to model the decision of the policy maker that is based on a stochastic model instead of on a deterministic one. Furthermore, differently with respect to the previous researches, that focused basically on macroeconomic impact, here we modelled the impact of the different lock-down at microeconomic level: in particular, by means of difference in difference, we evaluated the effect of the different levels of restrictions on the sales for different product types in Italy. Thus the final output of the model will be not only the cumulative deaths, but also the economic damage for each selling sector. Moreover here we also considered that there is not only an economic cost for each death, as done by \cite{kabir2020evolutionary} but there is also average cost for each infected person (referring to Italian data), because a consistent part of them may be recovered or even should take the intensive therapy. In this paper three approaches were simulated that basically shape three different PM: a very careful one, a lazy one that adopts a \textit{laissez-faire} strategy and an intermediate one. For each scenario, we will discuss the result of the simulation and then we will compare them in order to get a general insight. 

\section{Model and methods}

The model of the present study is composed by an epidemiological part, that shapes the diffusion of the virus, and then its output is used by the economic model to quantify the damage. Thus we will discuss the epidemiological part and then the economic one

\subsection{Epidemiological model}

Among the very large number of compartmental model that are available in the literature \cite{vynnycky2010introduction}, we considered as the simulator of the epidemic diffusion the simplest one: the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIRD). Our choice is motivated by the fact that this relative simple model provide the gross features of an epidemic \cite{fernandez2020estimating,al2020forecasting} with a relative small number of parameters. Thus, because the final goal of the present article is an insight on the effects of the PM care of pandemic, an not a fine grained description of the epidemics due to COVID-19, such model is suitable for our proposes\footnote{One in principle can consider a SIRD model,in which the parameters that are time-dependent, as done by Ferrari et al. in Ref. \cite{ferrari2020modelling} for the description of Italian situation. On the other side it is possible to increase the complexity of the model with other compartments as done in the following paper \cite{giordano2020modelling} by Giordano et al. Note that in this last case the resolution of 9 differential equation is required (accompanied by the estimation of a large number of parameters)}). The SIRD model,first proposed by Kermack and McKendrick \cite{kermack1927contribution}, is given by the following set of differential equations\cite{vynnycky2010introduction}:  
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
\dfrac{dS(t)}{dt} & = - \frac{\beta I(t) S(t)}{N} \\
\dfrac{dI(t)}{dt} & = \frac{\beta I(t) S(t)}{N} -\gamma I(t) -\mu I(t) \\
\dfrac{dR(t)}{dt} & = \gamma I(t) \\
\dfrac{dD(t)}{dt} & = \mu I(t)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where S is the number of people that are still susceptible, I the number of people that are infected  and R people that are recovered while D are people that are death. N denotes the total popolation, that for the timing considered here can be considered fixed \footnote{Othervise, if longer horizontal timing is considered, it is necessary to consider also a source term for the births and a well term for the natural deaths. For further details see \cite{vynnycky2010introduction}}. On the other side $\beta$,$\gamma$ and $\mu$ are the parameters that shape the probability by which one individual in the model moves from a compartment to another: in particular $\beta$ is the probability to be infected, $\gamma $ the probability to recover and $\mu$ the probability to die (basically the lethality defined  as the probability to die conditionally to be ill). Usually epidemiologist are interested in the ratio:  
\begin{equation} 
R_{0}=\dfrac{\beta}{\gamma}
\end{equation}
know as the basic reproduction factor. This number, that is the average number of people that are infected by a single individual, describe if the epidemic is in a negative feedback (R$_{0}$<1), stationary (R$_{0}$=1), or in a positive feedback (R$_{0}$>1). As consequence if the epidemic is in a negative feedback it will be going to dissipate, if it is in positive feedback it will grow. Note that in this simple model since the parameters are not time dependent this factor is constant. If, as performed by \cite{ferrari2020modelling}, one consider time dependet parameters it will obtain a time depended parameter called $R_{t}$. For the present work we considered the parameter estimation for Lombardy provided by Neves and Guerrero in Ref \cite{neves2020predicting}: $\beta$ was set equal to 0.55 while $\gamma$ equal to $\frac{1}{7}$. The overall population $N$ was set to 60M, in order to simulate Italian population.  Within the daily temporal evolution of this model, that was obtained by numerically solving the differential equation above via the \textit{DeSolve} package, we considered a trigger activated by the PM every 7 days: if the number of infected people normalized by the overall population is more than $1\times 10^{-7}$, there is a probability that the PM impose laws that multiply the $\beta$ factor by $0.7$, if the normalized infected people are more than 10 the previous threshold  she will impose, with a certain probability, restrictions that multiply the $\beta$ starting $\beta$ factor by $0.25$, finally if the  threeshold is exceeded more than 50 times the PM will impose with a certain probability restrictive measures that multiply the $\beta$ by $0.025$. As we said the PM act with a certain probability: in particular each week a random number is extracted: if this is higher than a certain threshold the relative restrictive decision is taken, otherwise not. The threshold value capture the PM attitude to impose the lock-down: lower values model a careful PM, hight value a lazy one. In this way the model is able to simulate different scenarios for the different PM attitude: as we will see this can produce two very different results.
